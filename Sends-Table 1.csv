4,8/31/18,,JW,5,2,Blue,Vertical,Large Slopers,Fun balancey sloper problem. Over once you hit the bowling ball hold. Went in like 15 mins,1,1,,
5,8/31/18,,EE,4,1,Black,Vertical,"Crimpy pinches, Quarter Pad Crimps, Positive Ledgy Slopers",Using the three quarter pads as an intermediate to bump to the good sloper helped,1,1,,
4,9/4/18,,JC,4,1,Blue,"Low Angle, Slab","Fat Pinches, Flat Slopers, Narrow Pinch",Really fun mantle and had to trust smear on volume to match the finish foothold. Also the heelhook to stabilize on the pinch helped.,,1,,
4,9/4/18,,RMS,1,1,White,Low Angle,Flat Pinches (Rails),Smarter Foot Beta to be had,,1,,
4,9/5/18,,KJ,1,1,Orange,Low Angle,"Small flat edges, medium pinches","Casual Flash, Fun traverse at beginning",,1,,
4,9/5/18,,JW,6,1,Pink,Overhung (30 Degrees),Large Jugs,Despite being juggy all the holds were facing the wrong way. Interesting pseudo kneebar at first move.,,1,,
4,9/5/18,,RAB*,1,1,Red,Vert with a slight low angle section,,,,1,,
4,9/5/18,,MM/ARV (me)*,5,1,Green,Vert with a slight low angle section,,,,1,,
4,9/7/18,,GW,16,1,White,Slab,"Flat Jug, Rail, Small flat half pad edge",The mantel on the pinch rail was really fun. What unlocked this problem is getting low and shimmying up on the ledge to gain the corner and then shifting foot over to stand and then dyno to the end.,,1,,
4,9/10/18,,ALS,1,1,White,"Overhung (30 Degrees), Dihedral","Small incut jugs, large rail jugs",Twistlocking to gain the last hold was a little tough but an easy 4,,1,,
5,9/10/18,,WW,1,1,Blue,Overhung (30 Degree),"Small incut pinches, crimpy pinches",Really fun problem and my first 5 flash. I felt really in control the whole way through.,,1,,
4,9/10/18,,RMS,8,1,Orange,Overhung (30 Degree),Juggy Slots,,,1,,
4,9/12/18,,KJ,1,1,Purple,Roof,"Large Jugs, Flat slopers with ridges on top","Fun move to cut feet, easy onsight and getting low on the slopers were not bad due to the ridges and me cheesing with height",,1,,
5,9/12/18,,KJ,10,3,Pink,Low Angle,"Fat Pinches, Sloper Pinch,  Flat Edge","Starting hangs crossed helped. I could have driven better with the heel hook to avoid readjusting, but switching feet and flagging out and hitting the bulb hold just right made this go.",,1,,
5,9/12/18,,ACD,5,1,Orange,Arete Vert,"Sledges, Incut Pinches",Definitely cheesed with height but a lot of core tension involved (full wingspan stretch),,1,,
4,9/13/18,,AWR,7,2,White,Overhanging Arete,"Volumes, mini jug, compression with pinches",Really tough start but once I figured out the right body position and foot beta it was straightforward after. Interesting and fun problem. Match could have been more controlled but it defintiely counts,,1,,
5,9/13/18,,RMS,2,1,Orange,Overhanging Arete,"Two Finger Pockets, Incut Crimps","Slight dab on volume,  but cutting feet and matching finish was probably incorrect but it works. Fun big cross to the second pocket which helped along with driving through with heel.",,1,,
4,9/17/18,,RMS,1,1,Orange,Vert,"Incut Crimps, Slopey Crimps",Deadpoint,,1,,
4,9/19/18,,EE,1,1,Black,Low Angle,"Incut Crimps, Slot Jugs",Easy Flash,,1,,
4,9/19/18,,JW,2,1,Pink,Low Angle,"Narrow Pinches, Medium Jugs",Tweaked knee a bit with an aggressive drop knee. Sequenced this incorrectly but many feet options made this not too bad,,1,,
4,9/19/18,,KJ,1,1,Blue,Prow (Overhang to Vert),Small incut crimpers,Very fingery but felt in control the whole way. The aggressiver backflag to reach high crimp made me feel stable,,1,,
4,9/21/18,,KJ,12,3,Orange,Overhung (20 Degrees),"Fat Pinches, input crimps",Had to stabilize heel hook wit toe drive and keep core tight to make this work,,1,,
4,9/23/18,,KJ,4,2,Pink,Prow (Overhang to Slab),"Slopey Pinches, half pad input crimps",Really desperate! The overhang section was clean but I got a weird kneeler on the pinch at the lip and was super desperate from here on out,,1,,
4,9/23/18,,KJ,1,1,White,Vert,"Slopey Edges,Juggy Underclings",Nice Heel hook. Tall man beta helped,,1,,
4,9/24/18,,RMS,2,1,Orange,Vert,"Slopey edge, uncut crimpers",Good dead point to the finish crimp,,1,,
4,9/24/18,,RMS,1,1,Red,Roof to Vert,Mega jugs,One key hold was blocked off for repair. Huge throw to the lip jug to send. The bicycle to stabilize helped too,,1,,
4,9/26/18,,JW,4,2,Orange,Overhung (45 Degree),"Flat Sloper, Large Jugs, Incut Pinches",Very fun route. Big cross and cut feet to gain feet. Could trust heel took more on the sloper near the top,,1,,
4,9/26/18,,WW,6,1,Green,Overhung (25 Degree),Slot Jug,The dead point had to be super precise to the slot to make it work.,,1,,
5,9/28/18,,DA,1,1,Black,Overhung (25 Degree),"Pinch, sloper jugs","Felt very soft, skipped a key hold with a dead point",,1,,
4,10/1/18,,KJ,1,1,Red,Low Angle ,"Mega jug, two finger jug pockets",Fun Dyno! Pocket part was not tweaky and I climbed it well,,1,,
4,10/1/18,,DA,1,1,Purple,Overhung (30 Degrees),"Incut Pinches, Mini jugs",Lot of stepping through and I had a lot more control which made me tired. I could have deadpointed and sequenced better,,1,,
4,10/1/18,,JW,1,1,Orange,Overhung (45 Degrees),Knobby Pinches,Huge cross at start to knobby pinch,,1,,
4,10/1/18,,ALS,1,1,Purple,Vert,Incut crimps,"Tall man beta with a ton of core tension, foot beta could have been smarter. ",,1,,
4,10/1/18,,KJ,1,1,Red,Low Angle,"Flat Slopers, Faceless Slopers",Fun dead point at start and nice heel hook to drive into a pseudo mantel to reach for sloper. The traverse was smooth,,1,,
4,10/3/18,,AWR,1,1,Green,Overhung (30 Degrees),"Slopey Pinches, Fat Pinches, Mega Jugs",Fun route with a pseudo rose move,,1,,
4,10/5/18,,RMS,1,1,Green,Overhung (15-20 degrees),"Incut Crimps, Large Jugs",Large dead point to skip terrible intermediate. Smear up and then backlog to bump to finish. Fun!,,1,,
5,10/5/18,,JC,2,1,Pink,Low Angle,Bulbous slopers,Ball Slopers strike again! Fun deadpoint to skip the “bad” hold and stick it.,,1,,
5,10/5/18,,WW,7,2,Black,Vert,Rounded Slopers,Hard but fun mantel. Really had to take it slow on the balance vert section,,1,,
4,10/8/18,,JW,6,2,Black,Low Angle/Overhang,Fat Ridged Pinch,Fun Mantel,,2,Foot work was clean on the initial part of the problem. I was accurate and precise,Didn’t trust feet on the latter half after the mantel. Had to knee scum a bit to shimmy over when I could’ve easily just stood up
4,10/8/18,,CL,6,1,Green,Slab,"Faceless Slopers, sloper with a decent lip, input sloper","Very technical and balanced, powerful finish",,2,I came into the fourth sloper well with momentum and drove in with heel well to finish. Sussed out beta pretty fast in like 15 mins,Could have meathooked the first sloper and I could have gotten lower on the really shitty one and trusted feet more getting low. Could brush down more
4,10/8/18,,KJ,1,1,Green,Steep Overhang (60 to 45 degrees),"Incut Mini Finger Buckets, juggy sloper",Very Crimpy,,2,Actually committed to getting the insight with the last throw. Good core tension,"Climbed pretty slow, could have flagged better and stepped through given how overhung this wall is. Definitely left right left righted a lot with some minor drop knees but could have been more efficient here. Don’t really want to resend this though."
4,10/9/18,,JC,1,1,Red,Vert,"Flat Slopers, Faceless Slopers",Mantel,,2,Mantel was smooth and controlled,Tall Manned End
4,10/9/18,,JC,5,1,Purple,Vert,"Crimpy micro pinch, tiny crimpers",Traverse,,2,Looked at where my feet were until they were placed.  Once I sequenced it correctly it went,Just tried to brute force it initially. Skipped bad holds at end to dyne to end
4,10/9/18,,JW,2,1,Green,Vert,Flat Rail,Traverse,,2,The traverse up to the last move felt really smooth and in control,"Didn’t trust good smear on the pinch, instead just jumped for finish"
4,10/9/18,,RMS,5,1,Blue,Vert,"Mono Pocket, Pocket Pinch",Route’s flow felt really good,,2,Trusted foot smear on edge of volume,"Kept throwing myself at it, felt really easy once I used correct beta"
5,10/9/18,,JW,6,1,Pink,Vert,"Sloper indercling, bulbous slopers",Fun bump to sloper undercling,,2,Got low on the slopers during traverse,Tall manned to reach  third sloper when it should have been a more dynamic move. A lot of core tension though
4,10/11/18,,RMS,2,1,Green,Vert,Half pad crimp edges,super fingers but good feet helped,,2,Trusted feet on the good foot holds,Sequenced incorrectly during my “flash” burn which led to me taking another attempt. Meh
4,10/11/18,,JC,4,1,Purple,Vert/Dihedral,"Bulbous sloper, narrow pinch rail",Some stemming required but a lot of beta required at the start to find the right body position,,2,"Post start, rest of the problem was sequenced correctly ",Lot of finagling at start and had to use an award backlog sequence to bump the bulbous sloper
4,10/15/18,,WW,3,1,Green,Slab/Vert,"Micro Crimps, Flat Slopers","Traverse, really small holds",,2,Really poor handholds but good feet which led to me weighting feet,"Gorilla stomped the initial hold to get a good placement, very little control."
4,10/15/18,,ALS,7,1,Orange,Vert with a slight low angle section,"Sloper Edges, bulbous pinches",Super dynamic,,2,Kept core really right to dynamically blast to the pinch and stick the swing.,"Got frustrated a bit, started running a fever"
5,10/15/18,,GW,9,1,Blue,Slab,"Pinchy rail, half pad input crimps, input jug ","Really fun problem, mantel, dynamic backswing",,2,"Core tension to hold swing, mantel was smooth with good hip position and was fluid. Dynamic move to the mediocre jug near the pinch was solid",Tall manned the end with little momentum to gain crimps
4,10/17/11,,JC,3,1,White,Prow (Overhang to Low Angle),"Sidepull jug, Blocky input pinch",Very dynamic and fun although definitely easier if you are tall,,2,The deadpoint to the far jug was controlled,Didn’t't turn heel out on the good pinch but opted to use toe drive. 
4,10/17/11,,RMS,3,1,Blue,Vert with a slight low angle section,Slot Jugs,Blew the insight with failing to match. Campuses it on the send go. Huge cross to the slot,,2,The big cross to the slot jug was precise and didn’t blow it,A lot of misreading and playing around with feet on different holds rather than committing. Also the end was a control match but could have been a lot cleaner
4,10/19/11,,RMS,6,1,White,Overhung to low angle (30 Degree),"Side pull Jug, circular slope pinches",Very dynamic at the bottom with a technical upper section,,2,When I took the time to read it correctly it immediately went due to smart foot beta at bottom which made the large dynamic cross easier.,Sequenced top incorrectly and got frustrated at bottom. Little bit of groveling at top
4,10/21/18,,ACD,2,1,Black,"Vert with a slight prow, Arete","Large flat jug, pockets","Dyno, traverse, arete. Well set and fun",,2,The dyno was clean I controlled momentum well. Easy second go,On Initial read missed a key hold and tried for this hard mantel using the foothold edges to stabilize with heel on flat plane. There was a large jug after the initial dyno which was easy
4,10/21/18,,ALS,2,1,Red,Overhung (25 Degree),"Positive Undercling, tiny fingerbucket, sloppy input edges",Very dynamic and powerful!,,2,Tried two vastly different sequences but the second one was strange with a lot of smearing to gain the ,The sequence I used worked but felt a little desperate throughout the whole problem. I knew I would send it but felt medium percentage
4,10/21/18,,GW,1,1,Orange,Overhung (45 Degree to Low Angle),"Tiny input crimpers, fat pinches, sloppy rail",Very long route on the overhang but not exhausting,,2,Lot of flagging and I felt as if I flowed really well trough the problem,Full crimped the second edge
4,10/21/18,,KJ,8,1,Black,Overhung (25 Degree),"Textured slopers, medium pinches, tiny feet","Backflag to reach to second medium pinch, bump to blobby sloper. Was well set and fun to climb",,2,,Didn't place foot accurately at all on the small edge when placing the drop knee. Had trouble actually committing to the sloper due to me being tired but once I found the sweet spot it felt straightforward
5,10/23/18,,RMS,17,2,Pink,"Slab, Arete","Slopey Edges, Sloper",,,2,"Nothing felt desperate or thuggy,. Everything was very thought out and methodical",Kept throwing myself at this with inadequate rest. 
4,10/23/18,,AWR,20,2,Red,Overhung (45 Degree),"Juggy sidepull, pinches on volumes","Really really fun problem when I was actually fresh and not mad. Really well set with the heel hook to bump to the pinch, Fun dead points at end with nice passive heel too!",,2,Watched a stronger climber easily insight this and took his foot beta on the part that I was struggling with,Got really really frustrated . Could have stepped through on the starting jug to reach the mini jug
5,10/25/18,,DA,7,2,Red,Prow (Overhang to Slab),"Fat Sloper, textured sloper, crimpy underclings, crispy sidepulls, fat pinch",A lot of holds and really fun climb in two very distinct flavors.,,2,Bottom part felt really good since I matched the fat pinch to drop knee. Doing a pseudo mantel on the fat sloper on the slab was really fun and helped stabilize my left foot.,Full crimped the textured sloper with hands crossed so I could find the right feet on the slab portion 
4,10/28/18,,GW,23,3,Blue,Low Angle ,"Slopey Sidepull, Gaston Pinch, Two Finger pocket, Pinchy undercling",Really cool problem and a mini project and a very hard 4. Slight dab on the white hold on aerie at end but didn't use it to press so I will count the send.,,,Sequenced the problem well and really dialed it. Nice backlog to secure the mono and go for the bump to the slopey side pull,"Had trouble trusting feet but this is due to my feet hurting from outside yesterday. Toes need a break, had a lot of trouble keeping tension on the gaston and switch to side pull on send go. "
4,10/31/18,,RN,13,3,Black,Slab,"Pinchy Sloper, Frictioned Sloper, Mono positive crimp, pinchy half pad crimp, foothold",Hard for a 4. Had to get really low and stick hips to wall to send the match. Learned a lot about body positioning and trusting terrible feet.,,,Positioned hips well on climb and ,Full crimped the foothold at end
4,11/1/18,,KJ,1,1,,20 Degree Overhang,"Fat Incut Pinches, Slopey Pinches, Bulbous Slopers",Sequences beginning wrong initially. Skipped two holds (both really good) and dead pointed with high foot to finish jug,,,Lot of flagging and I was conscious of feet placement,Read Beginning sequence wrong and climbed slowly
4,11/1/18,,KJ,1,1,,30 Degree Overhang to Vert,"Large Rounded Sloper, Slopey jugs",Large dead point to third sloppy jug which I used with too much force so I hit it hard.,,,Good stepping through and nice cross to the sloper,Cut feet accidentally due to not putting enough pressure on the high foot. It was quite greasy.
